# Connections Game

This is a simple command-line version of the Connections game, inspired by the NYT Connections game.

## How to Play

1. Run the `connections_game.py` file using Python:
   ```
   python connections_game.py
   ```

2. The game will display 16 words numbered from 1 to 16.

3. Your goal is to find groups of 4 words that belong to the same category.

4. Enter your guess by typing the numbers of the words you think belong together, separated by spaces. For example:
   ```
   Enter your group (e.g., '1 5 9 13'): 1 5 9 13
   ```

5. If your guess is correct, the game will remove those words and tell you which category you've found.

6. If your guess is incorrect, you can try again.

7. The game continues until you've found all categories or you choose to quit.

8. To quit the game at any time, enter 'q' when prompted for input.

## Game Rules

- There are 4 categories, each containing 4 words.
- You must find all 4 words in a category to complete it.
- The game ends when you've found all 4 categories.

Enjoy playing the Connections Game!
