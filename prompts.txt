1. Create a "connections" app for a game similar to the NYT connections game using Python.
2. Create a README.md file with instructions for the game.
3. Modify the game so that a new game is generated each time.
4. Commit these changes and upload to GitHub.
5. Do you have access to all my prompt history. I would like you to save them to a file called prompts.txt
